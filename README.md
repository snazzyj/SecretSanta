# Getting Started
Creating and organizing a Secret Santa event has never been easier. Sign up with an email to create a new Secret Santa pool. The app will automatically pair everyone up in the pool and send a confirmation email which includes who they have been paired up with along with a verification code to confirm their status in your Secret Santa event. From there, each person can customize their profile to add their own interests and see who they have paired in case they forgot. You can view your pairs profile to get an idea of their interests.
